#### **Detail of Project**
>Spatial values helping creators and various brands create their own space in the metaverse to share culture. We empower users to use this amazing space to share amazing content, build tight communities, and drive meaningful sales of their creative work and products. It empowers users to create beautiful and functional 3D spaces that they can create with NFTs and sell/rent to others who want to host amazing experiences.

>Metaverse provides creators with the opportunity to make a living around their work. We believe the metaverse is also an opportunity for creators, backers, and fans to interact more closely than ever before. And the metaverse must be open and interoperable. Users can easily connect their space to other platforms and import content seamlessly. All of this is possible through blockchain.

>As an early member of Spatial, I participated from the very beginning and as the main developer, I set up most of the structure and participated in overall development, contributing to setting up the overall structure of Spatial as it is today.
